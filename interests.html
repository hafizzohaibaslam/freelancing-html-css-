            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>One of my biggest interests is programming. I love to code in different languages such as Python,
                    Java, and C++. I enjoy solving problems using programming logic and creating new applications that
                    can make people's lives easier.</p>
                <p>Recently, I have been learning about machine learning and AI, and I find it fascinating how machines
                    can learn and improve over time based on data inputs.</p>
                <p>Check out my <a href="demos.html#css-demo">CSS Demo</a> to see some of my programming skills in
                    action!</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>Cybersecurity is another area of computing that I find very interesting. I believe that everyone
                    should have some basic knowledge of cybersecurity to protect themselves from online threats. </p>
                <p>Learning about encryption, secure coding practices, and ethical hacking is crucial in today's digital
                    world. </p>
                <p>If you are interested in cybersecurity, I recommend checking out some online courses or resources to
                    learn more about this field.</p>
